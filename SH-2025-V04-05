#NOTE: Minority hole concentration is computed in n-type region in which holes are minority carriers.
#Minority electron concentration is computed in p-type region in which electrons are minority carriers.
#Material/ Bias specific values may be changed as per requirement of the user.

#Length for plot
x_p=np.linspace(-7e-3,w_p,100)    #Position along the p-type region, edge of depletion region at 0, assumed to be smaller than the scale of xp (A1)
x_n=np.linspace(w_n,7e-3,100)     #Position along the n-type region, edge of depletion region at 0, assumed to be smaller than the scale of xp (A2)

#Description of the assumptions, A1 and A2
#Here, xn and xp are the depletion region widths in the p-type and n-type regions. Actually, they have a finite width because w_n + w_p = total depletion
#width at the junction. However, in order to simplify the calculation, and because the order of w_n (or w_p) is quite smaller than the scale of x_n (or x_p),
#w_n = w_p ~ 0 is taken as a suitable assumption.
