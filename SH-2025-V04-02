#NOTE: Minority hole concentration is computed in n-type region in which holes are minority carriers.

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

#Constants
q = 1.6e-19          #Electronic charge (C)
n_i = 1.5e10         #Intrinsic carrier concentration in silicon (cm^-3)
Nd = 1e18            #Doping concentration (cm^-3)
k = 8.617e-5         #Boltzmann constant (eV/K)
T = 300              #Temperature (K)

#Applied Bias
V_app=np.linspace(-0.7,0.7,100)    #Range of applied bias across the p-n junction

#Expression of hole (minority carrier) concentration at the edge of the depletion region in n-type region
p_n=((n_i**2)/Nd)*np.exp(V_app/(k*T))

#Expression of excess hole (minority carrier) concentration at the edge of the n-type region
dp_n=p_n-((n_i**2)/Nd);

# 2D plot of Minority Hole Concentration vs. Applied Bias
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.plot(V_app, dp_n)

# Add labels and title
plt.xlabel('Applied Bias, V_app (V)')
plt.ylabel('Excess Minority Hole Concentration, dp_n (cm$^{-3}$)')
plt.title('Excess Minority Hole Concentration vs. Applied Bias')
plt.grid(True)

# Display the plot
plt.show()
